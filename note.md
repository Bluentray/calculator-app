i want to build a calculator app that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations, etc. the app should have a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and error messages.

the app is going to be published on the google play store. the app should be compatible with android 5.0 and above. the app should be able to run on any android device with a screen size of 6.5 inches or larger.


Let me summarize the changes I've made:

Created a comprehensive project structure for an Android Calculator App
Implemented key files:
README.md: Project overview and technical specifications
build.gradle.kts: Project and app-level Gradle configuration
activity_main.xml: User interface layout with a responsive grid design
styles.xml: Custom button styles for a clean, modern look
CalculatorViewModel.kt: Business logic for calculator operations
MainActivity.kt: UI controller and event handling
AndroidManifest.xml: App configuration with screen size and Android version compatibility
strings.xml: App name and description resources
Key Features:

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root
Error handling for divide by zero and negative square roots
Compatible with Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and above
Designed for devices with 6.5-inch screens or larger
Modern MVVM architecture
Clean, responsive UI
Next steps for you would be to:

Open the project in Android Studio
Sync Gradle dependencies
Run the app on an emulator or physical device
Test all calculator operations
Prepare for Google Play Store submission
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or discuss the next steps for publishing the app?
